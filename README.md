# FOCUS *maybe*...

FOCUS *maybe*... A simple hardware device: timer to fight with distractions :).

It totally builds on idea of the [Project IGOR](https://github.com/UrbanCircles/igor). I love IGOR timer.

Clue is: a physical device being a simple timer with predetermined time values to help retain focus on a task in a distraction full environment.

It has the following principles

- battery powered
- knob to control
- simplest possible display - alphanumeric segmented display
- predetermined times: 15, 30, 45, 60, 90

## Motivation

Personally, I proven that using “gravity cube timer” was extremely useful for my use case (tasks management/focus + distractions), but I was fed up by it’s paused idle time - after 5 minutes of inactivity in paused state, this small dreadful device just entirely resets it’s countdown value (it will still show you a 1-second glimps of it before it resets, though…)! Frustrating.
